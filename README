CompiTeX : Convert LaTeX equations to equivalent C-Code.

Acks 

This tool is based on Thomas Niemann's Lex & Yacc tutorial,
Many thanks go to him for writing such a great document. I
tried to contact him but failed, hopefully this could be 
rectified soon.

Disclaimer

CompiTeX is still at a very early phase of development - Obviously !
At best it's still just a proof-of-concept that could be usable with
some tweaking.
