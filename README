CompiTeX : Convert LaTeX equations to equivalent C-Code.

Acks 

This tool is based on Thomas Niemann's Lex & Yacc tutorial,
Many thanks go to him for writing such a great document. I
tried to contact him but failed, hopefully this could be 
rectified soon.

Disclaimer

CompiTeX is still at a very early phase of development.
Currently, its best used as a semi-auto solution for code
where you'd need to code a large number of equations.

Compiling

You need to have bison and flex installed to be able to
compiled copmitex.

Usage

compitex filename

filename  : A plain text file containing the LaTeX equations
            to be converted. Each equation on a separate line.
